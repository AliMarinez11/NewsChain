Early signs are discouraging, since Putin refused to sign up for Trump's proposal of a 30-day ceasefire. But Trump is framing the opening of any dialogue as a triumph. And each leader is trying to manipulate the diplomacy to their own ends and playing the public relations game - not least to escape blame if everything falls apart. The White House is spinning a fiction of significant progress both to keep alive the chances of a peace process developing and to support the increasingly tenuous conceit that Trump is a great dealmaker, uniquely able to forge peace. Related article In Ukraine and Gaza, Trump finds out that ending wars is tougher than it looks Putin flatly refused Trump's big ask on the ceasefire.

Trump proposed a 30-day ceasefire, which Putin rejected, indicating his unwillingness to end the war at this time. Despite the setback, Trump framed the opening of dialogue as a triumph. The White House portrayed the negotiations as significant progress to maintain the possibility of a peace process and support the narrative of Trump's dealmaking abilities.

The case, brought by a coalition of states and immigrant rights groups, argues that the Act, dating back to 1798, is being misused in peacetime to target specific communities, particularly Venezuelans accused of gang affiliations. Lower courts have issued conflicting rulings, with some blocking the deportations and others upholding the administration's actions. The Supreme Court's decision could set a precedent for the scope of executive power in immigration enforcement. Legal scholars expect a divided court, with conservative justices likely to support Trump's authority and liberal justices questioning the Act's applicability. The case has drawn significant attention amid broader debates over immigration policy and constitutional checks."

Immigrant rights groups and several states argue that the 18th-century law is being applied inappropriately during peacetime, violating constitutional protections. The Trump administration defends the policy as a necessary measure to enhance public safety, citing national security concerns. The case has sparked a legal battle, with lower courts issuing mixed rulings—some have halted the deportations, while others have upheld them. The Supreme Court's ruling could redefine the limits of executive power in immigration matters, with implications for future administrations. Observers anticipate a contentious debate, reflecting the court's ideological divide on issues of immigration and governmental authority."

Speaking at a press conference in St. Paul, Walz argued that the campaign's focus on rural voters and economic populism was the right approach, even though it failed to resonate with enough voters to defeat President Donald Trump. \"We spoke to the heart of America, to workers and families who feel left behind,\" Walz said. Critics within the Democratic Party have blamed Walz and presidential nominee Kamala Harris for not addressing key issues like inflation and immigration more effectively. Some party strategists argue that Walz's folksy style, while appealing in Minnesota, did not translate nationally. The Democratic National Committee is expected to conduct a post-mortem to analyze the 2024 election results."
