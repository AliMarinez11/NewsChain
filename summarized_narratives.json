Senate Democrats’ decision to allow Republicans to pass a spending bill will avert a short-term shutdown, but it will also give Republicans the power to grant President Donald Trump new leverage to control spending for the rest of the year. The Democrats’ tactical retreat from this spending battle means the government will remain open and Trump can more easily carry on with the systemic changes and deep cuts he has done heretofore without the blessing of Congress. Entire divisions at agencies such as the Department of Education and NASA have already been laid off, along with the gutting of the government’s consumer protection arm, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. A large-scale “reduction in force” of federal workers is expected in the near future. Americans are both deeply concerned and somewhat excited about the prospect of Trump’s cuts, whose potential breadth i"

Large campaign rallies and town halls are pillars of election year politics, but two months into President Donald Trump's second term, town halls are erupting across the country. While Republicans have largely been told to stay home, Democrats seem to be driving the narrative for the first time since Trump returned to the White House. Democrats last week launched a coordinated effort to host \"People’s Town Halls\" in all 50 states after disruptive protests led Republican leadership to advise against hosting in-person town halls. The first week of town halls brought a new wave of political drama and engagement resembling that of an election year. \"When folks get out of the DC bubble and into communities across the country, there is one undeniably clear trend emerging: Americans are feeling betrayed by Republicans. Across party lines, people are furious th"

            "summary": "President Donald Trump's proposed government cuts have elicited mixed reactions among Americans, with some expressing concern while others are excited about the potential changes. Senate Democrats' decision to allow Republicans to pass a spending bill has given Trump more leverage to implement these cuts, which have already resulted in layoffs at agencies like the Department of Education and NASA, as well as the weakening of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Meanwhile, Democrats have been actively engaging in town halls across the country, driving the political narrative and highlighting public frustration with Republicans. These 'People's Town Halls' were launched in response to disruptive protests that led Republican leadership to advise against hosting in-person events."

It's that some senior Trump administration aides seem not to care if they did. There are even claims that some judges are simply too junior to question the actions of a president. The furor caused by the administration's peacetime use of wartime powers under the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act is the latest, and perhaps most overt, sign of President Donald Trump's sense of omnipotence. He's also betting voters will reward him for, in his view, keeping them safe with ruthless immigration enforcement rather than recoil from his challenges to the Constitution. The growing showdown is so critical because the courts are one of the final checks on Trump's power after he crushed opposition in the Republican Party and helped shut the Democratic Party out of any power in any branch of government in Washington.

A top former Bush administration lawyer is warning the White House not to begin ignoring court orders amid its standoff over President Donald Trump's deportation flights under the Alien Enemies Act. \"I worry that there might be some people in the administration who would actually like to defy a judicial order. Which I think would be a terrible mistake,\" John Yoo, Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of California at Berkeley, told Fox News Digital in an interview on Tuesday. More than a dozen injunctions have been levied to at least temporarily block Trump policies across the country, including his deportation flights, birthright citizenship reforms and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts. Republican allies of the president have accused \"activist judges\" of seeking to override the executive in an imp"

            "summary": "The Trump administration's use of executive power and its standoff with the judiciary over deportation policies has raised concerns about the balance of power. Some administration officials seem to disregard court orders, while critics warn against defying judicial authority. The administration's use of wartime powers under the Alien Enemies Act for peacetime deportations has been controversial. The situation highlights the tension between the executive branch and the courts, with implications for the separation of powers and the rule of law."

Trump used inaccurate figures for the number of votes he received in the 2024 presidential election, US aid to Ukraine, the number of migrants who entered the US during the Biden administration, the US trade deficits with China and Canada, and annual US fentanyl deaths. He also wrongly declared, again, that Honda announced it is building a new factory in Indiana. He repeated his years-old baseless claim that NATO would no longer have existed if not for his first presidency. He told his familiar unsubstantiated story about large numbers of migrants having come from jails in \"the Congo\" and elsewhere. And he once more discussed Canada's dairy tariffs without mentioning a critical fact about them. Here is a fact check.

Trump's comments came in response to statements Walz provided in a podcast with California Gov.

He lost an election,\" Trump said Friday in the Oval Office of the White House. \"He played a part. You know, usually a vice president doesn't play a part. They say. I think Tim played a part.
