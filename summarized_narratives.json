                    "content": "President Donald Trump's calls with President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky this week represent the most intense diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Ukraine since Russia's invasion three years ago. Early signs are discouraging, since Putin refused to sign up for Trump's proposal of a 30-day ceasefire. But Trump is framing the opening of any dialogue as a triumph. And each leader is trying to manipulate the diplomacy to their own ends and playing the public relations game - not least to escape blame if everything falls apart. The White House is spinning a fiction of significant progress both to keep alive the chances of a peace process developing and to support the increasingly tenuous conceit that Trump is a great dealmaker, uniquely able to forge peace. Related article In Ukraine and Gaza, Trump finds out that ending wars is tougher than it looks Putin flatly refused Trump's big ask on the ceasefire.

Trump proposed a 30-day ceasefire, but Putin refused to agree to it, indicating his unwillingness to end the war at this time. Despite this, Trump portrays the initiation of dialogue as a success. Both leaders are using the diplomacy for their own purposes and engaging in public relations strategies. The White House is promoting the idea of significant progress to maintain the possibility of a peace process and to support the notion of Trump as a skilled dealmaker. Meanwhile, U.S. officials are preparing for ceasefire talks with Russia, with Putin agreeing to temporarily halt strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station.

The case, brought by a coalition of states and immigrant rights groups, argues that the Act, dating back to 1798, is being misused in peacetime to target specific communities, particularly Venezuelans accused of gang affiliations. Lower courts have issued conflicting rulings, with some blocking the deportations and others upholding the administration’s actions. The Supreme Court’s decision could set a precedent for the scope of executive power in immigration enforcement. Legal scholars expect a divided court, with conservative justices likely to support Trump’s authority and liberal justices questioning the Act’s applicability. The case has drawn significant attention amid broader debates over immigration policy and constitutional checks."

                    "content": "The Supreme Court is set to review President Donald Trump’s deportation policy on March 23, 2025, in a case challenging the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport undocumented immigrants, particularly Venezuelans labeled as gang members. Immigrant rights groups and several states argue that the 18th-century law is being applied inappropriately during peacetime, violating constitutional protections. The Trump administration defends the policy as a necessary measure to enhance public safety, citing national security concerns. The case has sparked a legal battle, with lower courts issuing mixed rulings—some have halted the deportations, while others have upheld them. The Supreme Court’s ruling could redefine the limits of executive power in immigration matters, with implications for future administrations. Observers anticipate a contentious debate, reflecting the court’s ideological divide on issues of immigration and governmental authority."
