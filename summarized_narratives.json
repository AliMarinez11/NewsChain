As the U.S. prepares for ceasefire talks with Russia, there are concerns about how the Trump administration will approach the negotiations and push for an extension of the preliminary ceasefire. Putin has agreed to temporarily halt strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, including the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Station, Europe's largest nuclear power plant. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, are set to meet with a Russian delegation in Saudi Arabia to secure a ceasefire over the Black Sea. Additionally, military leaders from the UK and France are planning a 'coalition of the willing' for Ukraine."

Throughout his presidency, questions arose regarding his attempts to quash an FBI investigation, ignore subpoenas, and remain in office after losing an election. Currently, while Trump has stated he will not defy the courts, he has also joined calls for the impeachment of US District Judge James Boasberg. Chief Justice John Roberts has criticized such calls, emphasizing that the appeals process, rather than impeachment, is the appropriate avenue for disagreeing with court decisions. The articles suggest that the branches of government are on a collision course, with Congress, controlled by Republicans, being compliant with Trump.
