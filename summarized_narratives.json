Early signs are discouraging, since Putin refused to sign up for Trump's proposal of a 30-day ceasefire. But Trump is framing the opening of any dialogue as a triumph. And each leader is trying to manipulate the diplomacy to their own ends and playing the public relations game - not least to escape blame if everything falls apart. The White House is spinning a fiction of significant progress both to keep alive the chances of a peace process developing and to support the increasingly tenuous conceit that Trump is a great dealmaker, uniquely able to forge peace.

The furor caused by the administration's peacetime use of wartime powers under the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act is the latest, and perhaps most overt, sign of President Donald Trump's sense of omnipotence. He's also betting voters will reward him for, in his view, keeping them safe with ruthless immigration enforcement rather than recoil from his challenges to the Constitution.

The suit, brought by a group of Tesla owners, claims the company's Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) features do not perform as advertised, citing multiple accidents linked to the systems. \"Musk has repeatedly promised full autonomy, but the technology isn't there yet,\" said lead plaintiff John Doe, who claims his Tesla Model 3 failed to stop at a red light while in FSD mode. The lawsuit seeks damages and a court order to stop Tesla from marketing its systems as self-driving. Tesla has faced similar lawsuits in the past, with Musk defending the technology as a critical step toward safer roads. The company has not yet responded to the latest filing."

Critics within the Democratic Party have blamed Walz and presidential nominee Kamala Harris for not addressing key issues like inflation and immigration more effectively. Some party strategists argue that Walz's folksy style, while appealing in Minnesota, did not translate nationally.
