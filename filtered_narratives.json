Early signs are discouraging, since Putin refused to sign up for Trump's proposal of a 30-day ceasefire. But Trump is framing the opening of any dialogue as a triumph. And each leader is trying to manipulate the diplomacy to their own ends and playing the public relations game - not least to escape blame if everything falls apart. The White House is spinning a fiction of significant progress both to keep alive the chances of a peace process developing and to support the increasingly tenuous conceit that Trump is a great dealmaker, uniquely able to forge peace. Related article In Ukraine and Gaza, Trump finds out that ending wars is tougher than it looks Putin flatly refused Trump's big ask on the ceasefire.
