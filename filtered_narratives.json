The first week of town halls brought a new wave of political drama and engagement resembling that of an election year. \"When folks get out of the DC bubble and into communities across the country, there is one undeniably clear trend emerging: Americans are feeling betrayed by Republicans. Across party lines, people are furious th"

It\u2019s that some senior Trump administration aides seem not to care if they did. There are even claims that some judges are simply too junior to question the actions of a president. The furor caused by the administration\u2019s peacetime use of wartime powers under the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act is the latest, and perhaps most overt, sign of President Donald Trump\u2019s sense of omnipotence. He\u2019s also betting voters will reward him for, in his view, keeping them safe with ruthless immigration enforcement rather than recoil from his challenges to the Constitution. The growing showdown is so critical because the courts are one of the final checks on Trump\u2019s power after he crushed opposition in the Republican Party and helped shut the Democratic Party out of any power in any branch of government in Washington.

Which I think would be a terrible mistake,\" John Yoo, Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of California at Berkeley, told Fox News Digital in an interview on Tuesday. More than a dozen injunctions have been levied to at least temporarily block Trump policies across the country, including his deportation flights, birthright citizenship reforms and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts. Republican allies of the president have accused \"activist judges\" of seeking to override the executive in an imp"

Trump used inaccurate figures for the number of votes he received in the 2024 presidential election, US aid to Ukraine, the number of migrants who entered the US during the Biden administration, the US trade deficits with China and Canada, and annual US fentanyl deaths. He also wrongly declared, again, that Honda announced it is building a new factory in Indiana. He repeated his years-old baseless claim that NATO would no longer have existed if not for his first presidency. He told his familiar unsubstantiated story about large numbers of migrants having come from jails in \u201cthe Congo\u201d and elsewhere. And he once more discussed Canada\u2019s dairy tariffs without mentioning a critical fact about them. Here is a fact check.

President Donald Trump said former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, contributed to the Democrats' loss in the 2024 election. Trump\u2019s comments came in response to statements Walz provided in a podcast with California Gov. Gavin Newsom that aired on Tuesday, in which Walz predicted he could kick the \"a--\" of most Trump supporters. \"Well, he's a loser. Yeah. No, I think so. He lost an election,\" Trump said Friday in the Oval Office of the White House. \"He played a part. You know, usually a vice president doesn't play a part. They say. I think Tim played a part.
