The furor caused by the administration\u2019s peacetime use of wartime powers under the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act is the latest, and perhaps most overt, sign of President Donald Trump\u2019s sense of omnipotence. He\u2019s also betting voters will reward him for, in his view, keeping them safe with ruthless immigration enforcement rather than recoil from his challenges to the Constitution. The growing showdown is so critical because the courts are one of the final checks on Trump\u2019s power after he crushed opposition in the Republican Party and helped shut the Democratic Party out of any power in any branch of government in Washington.

Which I think would be a terrible mistake,\" John Yoo, Distinguished Professor of Law at the University of California at Berkeley, told Fox News Digital in an interview on Tuesday. More than a dozen injunctions have been levied to at least temporarily block Trump policies across the country, including his deportation flights, birthright citizenship reforms and Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts.

In his first term, it came up repeatedly: When he tried to quash an FBI investigation; when his administration ignored subpoenas; and when he tried to stay in office after losing an election. Now, while Trump has said he won\u2019t defy the courts, he has also joined calls among his allies for US District Judge James Boasberg to be impeached. Chief Justice John Roberts rebuked such calls, without naming Trump, and said that the appeals process, not impeachment, is the avenue to disagree with courts. Read the latest CNN report.

Even before Trump rattled the stock market this week by acknowledging his trade agenda could trigger a recession, several public polls had shown his job approval for managing the economy lagging below his overall job performance rating as president. That\u2019s a dramatic reversal from Trump\u2019s first term, when approval for his handling of the economy exceeded his overall approval rating every time the CNN/SRSS, Gallup or CNBC polls asked the public about both over his four years. In an early February poll this year, by contrast, Gallup found, for the first time, that fewer people gave Trump positive marks on the economy than on his overall performance \u2014 and that his economic grades were lower than at a"
