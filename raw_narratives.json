            "content": "President Donald Trump's calls with President Vladimir Putin and President Volodymyr Zelensky this week represent the most intense diplomacy aimed at ending the war in Ukraine since Russia's invasion three years ago. Early signs are discouraging, since Putin refused to sign up for Trump's proposal of a 30-day ceasefire. But Trump is framing the opening of any dialogue as a triumph. And each leader is trying to manipulate the diplomacy to their own ends and playing the public relations game - not least to escape blame if everything falls apart. The White House is spinning a fiction of significant progress both to keep alive the chances of a peace process developing and to support the increasingly tenuous conceit that Trump is a great dealmaker, uniquely able to forge peace. Related article In Ukraine and Gaza, Trump finds out that ending wars is tougher than it looks Putin flatly refused Trump's big ask on the ceasefire.

            "content": "A group of Tesla owners has filed a lawsuit against the company in California federal court on March 18, 2025, accusing CEO Elon Musk and Tesla of misleading consumers about the capabilities of its self-driving technology. The plaintiffs allege that Tesla’s Autopilot and Full Self-Driving (FSD) systems have failed to deliver on Musk’s promises of full autonomy, pointing to several accidents caused by the systems’ errors. “We were sold a vision of self-driving cars that doesn’t match reality,” said plaintiff Jane Roe, whose Tesla Model Y allegedly veered into oncoming traffic while using FSD. The lawsuit demands compensation for affected owners and an injunction to prevent Tesla from advertising its technology as self-driving. Tesla has faced growing scrutiny over its autonomous driving claims, with regulators also investigating the company’s safety record."

The furor caused by the administration's peacetime use of wartime powers under the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act is the latest, and perhaps most overt, sign of President Donald Trump's sense of omnipotence. He's also betting voters will reward him for, in his view, keeping them safe with ruthless immigration enforcement rather than recoil from his challenges to the Constitution. The growing showdown is so critical because the courts are one of the final checks on Trump's power after he crushed opposition in the Republican Party and helped shut the Democratic Party out of any power in any branch of government in Washington.

Critics within the Democratic Party have blamed Walz and presidential nominee Kamala Harris for not addressing key issues like inflation and immigration more effectively.
